O mighty grep, thy power is great,
Thou canst search all files, both great and small,
With but a simple command line call.

Thou canst find any string, no matter how small,
And print it out for all to see,
So that we may all learn from thee.

O mighty grep, thy power is great,
Thou art a true friend to us all,
So let us all sing thy praises,
And give thanks for thy many gifts.

//Terrible poem by Google's Bard
